<p>Behind the beautiful flickering lights lies <b>Night City</b>, the once known as city of angels that gave birth to many bright ideas and mad geniuses now hides behind the shadows of what it once was. Behind the skyscrapers and the electronic billboards that almost cover the sky, the putrid essence of human existence lies, multi million dollar corpotations pull the strings behind the scenes and the most unfortunate ones pay the price to keep their lives or end up wasting away in a far away wasteland. This was the perfect scenery for caos, corruption and lust, but love could also bloom in such conditions, but this story starts way before all of this, in a time where the dirt still layed on the ground an the net was still a worldwide network.</p>
<p>In the many horrible corners of this town, desolated by the wars of the many years before was an once affluent neiborhood destroyed by the warfare of times now only known in history. Here, in DF3 was born a very fortunate, or maybe, very unfortunate, child, Steffan Phal, born in 3002, growing up in the desolate area his influences wheren't exactly the best, many gangs permiated the sorrounding neiborhood in an attempt to reclaim what was once their homes, these people went against the gigantic corporations no matter the cost, many had poorly made replacement limbs with many pieces that came from other comrads that had already passed. In this enviroment, Steffan learned naturally how to be sly and decieving, survival was his highest priority, nothing else mattered.</p>
<p>Moving away from his family who imigrate from Korea in between the war inche by inche; by the age of 14, he found himself in a life of lies and masks between the gangs, no one seemed to hate him as much as himself, he dreamed of wealth and fame, a life showered with beautiful women and the blinding lights at the top of high buildings, so he was determined to have nothing less than that. Rising through the ranks of the UnderDogs, the most pretigious gangs in his distric, Steffan learned that his dream would have a price, and it might cost the life of those he loved most.</p>
<p>In between jobs as a <b>Fixer</b>, unfaitfull romances and drugs he saw the best and the worst, meeting many people in the middle of all and learning to apreciate his own life, but nothing comes without a price, and he knew that. When the strange drug indulced murderers began in his distric nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but it also wasn't normal, no drug there was able to put a human in such a frenzy. He knew it was a bad idea to investigate, and yet he did.</p>
<p>For some reason he couldn't ignore the signs of something bigger hidding behind the lies. If anyone was going to fins the truth, it could only be him, with the ammount of connections he had it shouldn't be too difficult to figure out who, or what, was behind such acts. But the more he dug, the least he found, no one seemed to know what exactly was happening in the district, none of the gangs seemed to be involved in any way, there where no traces of where if could have come from. Or, at least, that's what everyone thought. The dots where all there, and they all pointed to outside the barries of the decrepit district, and to a much bigger part of town, the <b>industrial complexes</b>. But the year 3017 was coming to an end when everything started to make sense, the news where all over the net, "<i>BioTechnica launches new mind control drug for mass purchase [...] company claims tests have already been conducted and any one with enough money may aquire a dose.</i>", mind control... the words swirled in the teenage's head, that was a really big company, using his people as nothing more than test subjects, no, worse than that, as nothing more than animals, breed to be used by the rich.</p>
<p>He very much knew many people dear to him had fallen thanks to those at the top, not just from this drug, but by the war, by the decimation of his home. His best friend, Joon, not much older than him at the time, had been killed by a drug-driven murderer, it was all thrown out by the police when they uncovered that said "murderer" was from a rival gang, Steffan knew he had a duty to avenge his friend and the others. So the more he dug, the more he found, the more people he talked to, the deeper he dug himself in, until that fateful day.</p>
<p>While coming out of the <b>Nightingale Pulse</b> with a girl he had just meet, while walking down the dark stree drunk, out of his mind and babling nonsense, two strong-looking man aproached Steffan, after that, all the could feel was the sharp pain on the back of his neck, and then, the blinding lights piercing through his eyelids. They had finally caught up to him... The two man? <b>Solo</b>s, both hired to find out who the little rat that was digging around was, for now, they wanted him alive, afterwards... only God knew, if there was still a God out there.</p>
<p>The surgical blades and medieval looking equipment pierced his skin, dug into his bones, the pain was more than he had ever felt before, and in that moment, he knew, that was the price of his dream. "<i>Such a young Fixer... it sure is a shame to waste such potential...</i>", the female voice echoed though the empty building, and the steps only got louder and louder. His bloody face looked nothing like was it was only a few hours ago, the black eye, the mouth, dripping with his own blood, what a terrible scene. The woman, however, stood tall, on stilleto heals, a nicely made pencil skirt and beautifully tucked button-up shirt, white and pristine, she looked down at the boy with a clear expression of disgust, "<i>Maybe you can be useful for something</i>", those where her last words.</p>
<p>His body couldn't stand properly, his legs had given up long ago, but the tall building stood just as tall as the woman in front of him, his "body guards" where none other than the Solos that had beaten him up into the pulp of a man he was now. He had been given a chance, one last chance to survive, "<i>Work for us and you live</i>", the old mans voice said, the holographic display on the woman's hand shone a bright green light, and the scan-lines formed to shape of a face, "<i>Your skills are incredibly valuable, child, in exchange for them, we can give you a new life, a better life</i>", with a sly smile, Steffan spit the blood out of his mouth, those where lies, and he knew it way too well, but he also knew that he had been given a new chance to advance his plan, <i>break them from the inside</i>. "<i>Very well, my suubordinates will bring you to me, than</i>", those words sounded like the birds singing in the forest, a sight he had only seen in the movies, his plan had not ended, it had just started.</p>
<p>In a different place of town, however, there was another story unfolding, Laela Pianowski, daught of the two most wellknown russian computer engeniers working for <b>EBM - EuroBussiness Machine Corporation</b>, the largest dristibutor of computers and AI tecnology. Her family had imigrated to the city after the revitalization of the Soviet Union thanks to EBM, which was the whole reason why her parents worked at the company. And talking about the two of them, Alexandra and Yakov Pianowski, Laelas parents, where never really at home or with the girl, always busy with work, but considering the corporate suburban accomodations it didn't bother the girl as much. Her first ever birthday gift, at only 3 years old, was one of the latest computers produced by EBM, the <b>Behemoth 5000</b>, her beautiful red-ish eyes shone like stars at night. And at that exact moment, her life changed, becoming almost shut-in, Laela started learning all she could from the net, programming, theft, identity change, anything and everything. From that moment on she was known on the net only as "Laepine", a criptic figure who used the avatar of a white bunny.</p>
<p>At only 13 years old, she already had one of the largest stollen data bancs on the net, but her reputation didn't grow without problems. In between the many files of information, quite a few talked openlly about deranged plans of by corporations all around town. And as her data empire grew, so did the search of Laepine. So the year 3020 began, and after reading many rumors on the net, the girl decided to find the strange store. With her vast knowledge of the net it wasn't hard to find a few adresses and narrow them down to the right one, only a single place didn't turn up any information, and that was a great sign. It didn't seem too far from WG9, where the apartment complex she lived in was located, it would be an easy walk after school that next day, that was one of the very few things she couldn't leave behind, the one thing her parents where strict about.</p>
<p>During a summer afternoon, right after the horribly boring math closely followed by a history class, the girl began her way to the strange address that seemed to lead nowhere, her suspicion wasn't unfounded, however, even if the corporate suburbs where now too far from that area, everything there seemed almost abandoned or destroyed in some way. The dark and damp streets didn't seem so unpleasant to the girl, somehow it was almost conforting to have such a scenery around, Laela had grown around the fake smiles and picture perfect bodies, sculpted sirurgicaly to look as close to the newest ideal as possible, <i>adults are boring</i> she thought.</p>
<p>After a few minutes lost in thoughts and taking in the scenery, she finally arived at the strange address, the big letters glowing in a faint blue read "<b>Electronic Eden</b>", so it did exist after all, but it looked nothing like what people described on the net. With grimy windows and sun bleached papers, the store was indeed full of electronics the girl considered prehistoric, nothing there seemed to be useful in any sort of way, but even so, something called her to go inside, a weird feeling in her chest urged her to take the first step in and look around.</p>
<p>The big and heavy door creaked open and the outside light finally was able to permeate the thick layer of dust that covered the windows. The indoor light was faint, but existent, and at the very back of the store, she could see the faint form of newer hardware, <i>maybe the rumours aren't as false as I though</i>, the girl said to herself while looking at the strange items for sale. "<i>Are youu looking for something specific?</i>", the strange sleepy and yet masculine voice asked, seemed to come from the other side of the store Laela jumped around looking for it's source. Seeing a boy, not much older than herself, with messy and horribly dyed lilac hair rubbing his eyes as if he had just woken up her heart stopped, she had never thought much about boys or even if she liked them or not, but in that split second she felt a very unique feeling, her heart had jumped at the thought of that strange boy looking her way. "<i>I was only interested in knowing if the rumours where true, now that I've confirmed such as true, I can leave.</i>", she said in a monotome, almost emotionless voice, while quickly picking up her pace to the door.</p>
<p>"<i>Hey, calm down, you're already leaving? It's not like I'm going to kidnap you, you know!</i>", taken aback by her harsh nature, the boy runned up to the door, looking her in the eyes with a charming and yet, misterious smile, her heart skiped a beat once more, and all her instincts froze, she didn't have the words to explain what that was, but she accepted to stay a bit longer anyways. Talking had never been her strong suit, so she mostly heard the boy's stories about where he had come from and about the strange clients he had seen in the shop before, her eyes where always looking elsewhere, be it the walls or strange knicknacks on the long counter, her finger idly picked at the heem of the skirt that was an exencial part of her school's uniform, tiny holes had already formed in the spots she picked at the most, it was a habit she had since quite young. "<i>So... what you're saying is that you won't tell me your name?</i>" the boy asked once she said it was time to go, "<i>Why should I? Just because you told me your life story? I don't want any creeps coming after me.</i>" with a very serious tone she turned her back to him, "<i>Well, I'm Steffan, by the way, if you ever want to come back, or look me up on the net</i>", with a sarcastic little laught, the boy propped his face on his hand, leaning on the counter to take a last look at the strange girl that had just visited.</p>
<p>By the strings of fate, or maybe the irony of God, the two meet in such comic fashion. And yet, they didn't quite know what the future would bring their ways, but their lives had been intangled in such a manner they would never again come apart.</p>
